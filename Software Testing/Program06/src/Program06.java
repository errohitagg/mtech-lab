 *              of the following words: not a quadratic equation, real roots, equal roots, imaginary roots.
 *              Design the test cases using the following techniques:
 *                  a. Boundary Value Analysis
 *                  b. Robustness Analysis
 *                  c. Worst Case Analysis
